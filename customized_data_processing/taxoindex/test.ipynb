       "  'Which of My Transient Type Checks Are Not (Almost) Free?. One form of type checking used in gradually typed language is transient type checking: whenever an object \\'flows\\' through code with a type annotation, the object is dynamically checked to ensure it has the methods required by the annotation. Just-in-time compilation and optimisation in virtual machines can eliminate much of the overhead of run-time transient type checks. Unfortunately this optimisation is not uniform: some type checks will significantly decrease, or even increase, a program\\'s performance. In this paper, we refine the so called\"Takikawa\"protocol, and use it to identify which type annotations have the greatest effects on performance. In particular, we show how graphing the performance of such benchmarks when varying which type annotations are present in the source code can be used to discern potential patterns in performance. We demonstrate our approach by testing the Moth virtual machine: for many of the benchmarks where Moth\\'s transient type checking impacts performance, we have been able to identify one or two specific type annotations that are the likely cause. Without these type annotations, the performance impact of transient type checking becomes negligible. Using our technique programmers can optimise programs by removing expensive type checks, and VM engineers can identify new opportunities for compiler optimisation.'],\n",

       "  'Type-preserving CPS translation of Σ and Π types is not not possible. Dependently typed languages such as Coq are used to specify and prove functional correctness of source programs, but what we ultimately need are guarantees about correctness of compiled code. By preserving dependent types through each compiler pass, we could preserve source-level specifications and correctness proofs into the generated target-language programs. Unfortunately, type-preserving compilation of dependent types is hard. In 2002, Barthe and Uustalu showed that type-preserving CPS is not possible for languages such as Coq. Specifically, they showed that for strong dependent pairs (Σ types), the standard typed call-by-name CPS is not type preserving. They further proved that for dependent case analysis on sums, a class of typed CPS translations—including the standard translation—is not possible. In 2016, Morrisett noticed a similar problem with the standard call-by-value CPS translation for dependent functions (Π types). In essence, the problem is that the standard typed CPS translation by double-negation, in which computations are assigned types of the form (A → ⊥) → ⊥, disrupts the term/type equivalence that is used during type checking in a dependently typed language. In this paper, we prove that type-preserving CPS translation for dependently typed languages is not not possible. We develop both call-by-name and call-by-value CPS translations from the Calculus of Constructions with both Π and Σ types (CC) to a dependently typed target language, and prove type preservation and compiler correctness of each translation. Our target language is CC extended with an additional equivalence rule and an additional typing rule, which we prove consistent by giving a model in the extensional Calculus of Constructions. Our key observation is that we can use a CPS translation that employs answer-type polymorphism, where CPS-translated computations have type ∀ α. (A → α) → α. This type justifies, by a free theorem, the new equality rule in our target language and allows us to recover the term/type equivalences that CPS translation disrupts. Finally, we conjecture that our translation extends to dependent case analysis on sums, despite the impossibility result, and provide a proof sketch.'],\n",

       "  'SOUL and Smalltalk - Just Married: Evolution of the Interaction between a Logic and an Object-Oriented Language towards Symbiosis. The Smalltalk Open Unification Language is a Prolog-like language embedded in the object-oriented language Smalltalk [5]. Over the years, it has been used as a research platform for applying logic programming to a variety of problems in object-oriented software engineering, some examples are: representing domain knowledge explicitly [3]; reasoning about object-oriented design [15,14]; checking and enforcing programming patterns [11]; ; checking architectural conformance [16] and making the crosscuts in Aspect-Oriented Programming more robust [6]. These examples fit in the wider research of Declarative Meta Programming, where SOUL is used as a meta language to reason about Smalltalk code. Recently, we explored a different usage of SOUL in connecting business rules and core application functionality [2], which involves reasoning about Smalltalk objects. We found we had to improve on SOUL’s existing mechanism for interacting with those objects because it was not transparent: it was clear from the SOUL code when rules were invoked and when messages were sent to objects, vice-versa solving queries from methods was rather clumsy. Ideally we would like to achieve a linguistic symbiosis between the two languages: the possibility for programs to call programs written in another language as if they were written in the same [8,13]. Such a transparent interaction would make it easy to selectively change the paradigm parts of an application are written in: if we find that a Smalltalk method is better written as a logic rule we should be able to replace it as such without having to change all messages invoking that method. We will here take a historical approach to describing the SOUL/Smalltalk symbiosis. We would like to provide an insight into our motivation for and approach to achieve the symbiosis by contrasting three distinct stages in its evolution. In a first stage, SOUL was developed as a direct Prolog-derivate with some additional mechanisms for manipulating Smalltalk objects as Prolog values. In a second and third stage we explored alternative mechanisms and a more Smalltalk-fitting syntax for SOUL.

       "  'A THEORY OF RUMOR TRANSMISSION. A theoretical framework is developed that demonstrates that the seemingly contradictory research conclusions that rumors expand and contract are actually complementary and that each is correct given the circumstances of its derivation. There is general agreement in the field that a rumor is an unconfirmed message passed from 1 person to another in face-to-face interaction that refers to an object person or situation rather than an idea or theory. Whether a rumor is truthful or untruthful is unimportant in studying its transmission. The essential features of a rumor are that it is unconfirmed at the time of transmission and that is passed from 1 person to another. The individual may find himself/herself in 1 of 3 orientations or situations in relation to a rumor: the rumor may cause the individual to take a critical set an uncritical set or a transmission set toward it. If the individual takes a critical set it means that he/she is capable of using \"critical ability\" to separate the true from the false in rumors. If an individual takes an uncritical set it means that he/she is unable to use \"critical ability\" to test the truth of the rumor he/she hears. If the individual takes the transmission set usually found in laboratory experiments his/her critical ability is irrelevant. Except for the natural redundancy of language past experiments on rumor transmission do not have redundancies. In a face-to-face conversation a person hears a rumor and asks for a clarification of message or source if he/she does not understand it. In a situation where a rumor is a topic of conversation and speculation interaction produces a modified \"Gestalt\" at every discussion of the rumor. There is another type of redundancy besides that brought about by the normal community setting the individual would probably hear the rumor more than once. Implicit in the discussion of single and multiple interactions is the idea of 2 different kinds of rumor patterns. In the 1st type the chain the rumor moves from person to person in a serial manner in a series of single interactions. In the 2nd type the network many people hear the rumor from more than 1 source. 2 group level variables operate to promote or retard the spreading or repeating of rumors: the structure of the group or public through which the rumor is spreading and the involvement or interest the group has in the topic. The empirical evidence suggests that where individuals have critical ability and interact with more than 1 person the rumor will become more precise with each transmission it will have its false elements stripped away and it will become more accurate because of cross checking with knowledgeable sources.'],\n",

       "  'Source-code queries with graph databases - with application to programming language usage and evolution. AbstractProgram querying and analysis tools are of growing importance, and occur in two main variants. Firstly there are source-code query languages which help software engineers to explore a system, or to find code in need of refactoring as coding standards evolve. These also enable language designers to understand the practical uses of language features and idioms over a software corpus. Secondly there are program analysis tools in the style of Coverity which perform deeper program analysis searching for bugs as well as checking adherence to coding standards such as MISRA.The former class are typically implemented on top of relational or deductive databases and make ad-hoc trade-offs between scalability and the amount of source-code detail held-with consequent limitations on the expressiveness of queries. The latter class are more commercially driven and involve more ad-hoc queries over program representations, nonetheless similar pressures encourage user-visible domain-specific languages to specify analyses.We argue that a graph data model and associated query language provides a unifying conceptual model and gives efficient scalable implementation even when storing full source-code detail. It also supports overlays allowing a query DSL to pose queries at a mixture of syntax-tree, type, control-flow-graph or dataflow levels.We describe a prototype source-code query system built on top of Neo4j using its Cypher graph query language; experiments show it scales to multi-million-line programs while also storing full source-code detail.'],\n",

       "  'Darjeeling, a feature-rich VM for the resource poor. The programming and retasking of sensor nodes could benefit greatly from the use of a virtual machine (VM) since byte code is compact, can be loaded on demand, and interpreted on a heterogeneous set of devices. The challenge is to ensure good programming tools and a small footprint for the virtual machine to meet the memory constraints of typical WSN platforms. To this end we propose Darjeeling, a virtual machine modelled after the Java VM and capable of executing a substantial subset of the Java language, but designed specifically to run on 8- and 16-bit microcontrollers with 2--10 KB of RAM. The Darjeeling VM uses a 16- rather than a 32-bit architecture, which is more efficient on the targeted platforms. Darjeeling features a novel memory organisation with strict separation of reference from non-reference types which eliminates the need for run-time type inspection in the underlying compacting garbage collector. Darjeeling uses a linked stack model that provides light-weight threads, and supports synchronisation. The VM has been implemented on three different platforms and was evaluated with micro benchmarks and a real-world application. The latter includes a pure Java implementation of the collection tree routing protocol conveniently programmed as a set of cooperating threads, and a reimplementation of an existing environmental monitoring application. The results show that Darjeeling is a viable solution for deploying large-scale heterogeneous sensor networks.'],\n",

Macros improve expressiveness, concision, abstraction, and language interoperability without changing the programming language itself. They are indispensable for building increasingly prevalent multilingual applications. Unfortunately, existing macro systems are wellencapsulated but unsafe (e.g., the C preprocessor) or are safe but tightlyintegrated with the language implementation (e.g., Scheme macros). This paper introduces Marco, the first macro system that seeks both encapsulation and safety. Marco is based on the observation that the macro system need not know all the syntactic and semantic rules of the target language but must only directly enforce some rules, such as variable name binding. Using this observation, Marco off-loads most rule checking to unmodified target-language compilers and interpreters and thus becomes language-scalable. We describe the Marco language, its languageindependent safety analysis, and how it uses two example target-language analysis plug-ins, one for C++ and one for SQL. This approach opens the door to safe and expressive macros for any language.'],\n",

       "  \"Inference of complex biological networks: distinguishability issues and optimization-based solutions. BACKGROUND The inference of biological networks from high-throughput data has received huge attention during the last decade and can be considered an important problem class in systems biology. However, it has been recognized that reliable network inference remains an unsolved problem. Most authors have identified lack of data and deficiencies in the inference algorithms as the main reasons for this situation. RESULTS We claim that another major difficulty for solving these inference problems is the frequent lack of uniqueness of many of these networks, especially when prior assumptions have not been taken properly into account. Our contributions aid the distinguishability analysis of chemical reaction network (CRN) models with mass action dynamics. The novel methods are based on linear programming (LP), therefore they allow the efficient analysis of CRNs containing several hundred complexes and reactions. Using these new tools and also previously published ones to obtain the network structure of biological systems from the literature, we find that, often, a unique topology cannot be determined, even if the structure of the corresponding mathematical model is assumed to be known and all dynamical variables are measurable. In other words, certain mechanisms may remain undetected (or they are falsely detected) while the inferred model is fully consistent with the measured data. It is also shown that sparsity enforcing approaches for determining 'true' reaction structures are generally not enough without additional prior information. CONCLUSIONS The inference of biological networks can be an extremely challenging problem even in the utopian case of perfect experimental information. Unfortunately, the practical situation is often more complex than that, since the measurements are typically incomplete, noisy and sometimes dynamically not rich enough, introducing further obstacles to the structure/parameter estimation process. In this paper, we show how the structural uniqueness and identifiability of the models can be guaranteed by carefully adding extra constraints, and that these important properties can be checked through appropriate computation methods.\"],\n",

As more applications migrate to the cloud, and as \"big data\" edges into even more production environments, the performance and simplicity of exchanging data between compute nodes/devices is increasing in importance. An issue central to distributed programming, yet often under-considered, is serialization or pickling, i.e., persisting runtime objects by converting them into a binary or text representation. Pickler combinators are a popular approach from functional programming; their composability alleviates some of the tedium of writing pickling code by hand, but they don\\'t translate well to object-oriented programming due to qualities like open class hierarchies and subtyping polymorphism. Furthermore, both functional pickler combinators and popular, Java-based serialization frameworks tend to be tied to a specific pickle format, leaving programmers with no choice of how their data is persisted. In this paper, we present object-oriented pickler combinators and a framework for generating them at compile-time, called scala/pickling, designed to be the default serialization mechanism of the Scala programming language. The static generation of OO picklers enables significant performance improvements, outperforming Java and Kryo in most of our benchmarks. In addition to high performance and the need for little to no boilerplate, our framework is extensible: using the type class pattern, users can provide both (1) custom, easily interchangeable pickle formats and (2) custom picklers, to override the default behavior of the pickling framework. In benchmarks, we compare scala/pickling with other popular industrial frameworks, and present results on time, memory usage, and size when pickling/unpickling a number of data types used in real-world, large-scale distributed applications and frameworks.'],\n",

It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so youll find it accessible whether youre most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++. The first chapter is a tutorial on the basic concepts of Go, introduced through programs for file I/O and text processing, simple graphics, and web clients and servers. Early chapters cover the structural elements of Go programs: syntax, control flow, data types, and the organization of a program into packages, files, and functions. The examples illustrate many packages from the standard library and show how to create new ones of your own. Later chapters explain the package mechanism in more detail, and how to build, test, and maintain projects using the go tool. The chapters on methods and interfaces introduce Gos unconventional approach to object-oriented programming, in which methods can be declared on any type and interfaces are implicitly satisfied. They explain the key principles of encapsulation, composition, and substitutability using realistic examples. Two chapters on concurrency present in-depth approaches to this increasingly important topic. The first, which covers the basic mechanisms of goroutines and channels, illustrates the style known as communicating sequential processes for which Go is renowned. The second covers more traditional aspects of concurrency with shared variables. These chapters provide a solid foundation for programmers encountering concurrency for the first time. The final two chapters explore lower-level features of Go. One covers the art of metaprogramming using reflection. The other shows how to use the unsafe package to step outside the type system for special situations, and how to use the cgo tool to create Go bindings for C libraries. The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of well-written Go code that cover the whole language, its most important packages, and a wide range of applications.

       "  'Learning associative Markov networks. Markov networks are extensively used to model complex sequential, spatial, and relational interactions in fields as diverse as image processing, natural language analysis, and bioinformatics. However, inference and learning in general Markov networks is intractable. In this paper, we focus on learning a large subclass of such models (called associative Markov networks) that are tractable or closely approximable. This subclass contains networks of discrete variables with K labels each and clique potentials that favor the same labels for all variables in the clique. Such networks capture the \"guilt by association\" pattern of reasoning present in many domains, in which connected (\"associated\") variables tend to have the same label. Our approach exploits a linear programming relaxation for the task of finding the best joint assignment in such networks, which provides an approximate quadratic program (QP) for the problem of learning a margin-maximizing Markov network. We show that for associative Markov network over binary-valued variables, this approximate QP is guaranteed to return an optimal parameterization for Markov networks of arbitrary topology. For the nonbinary case, optimality is not guaranteed, but the relaxation produces good solutions in practice. Experimental results with hypertext and newswire classification show significant advantages over standard approaches.'],\n",

       "  'SISAL: streams and iteration in a single-assignment language. Language reference manual, Version 1. 1. Many multi-processor systems are currently under study by various groups around the world. The understanding and exploitation of parallelism in these systems is a primary goal of these studies. To facilitate the use and comparison of these systems, we proposed to define a common high-level language. The primary candidate was a single-assignment, applicative, dataflow language. In spite of remarkable diversity in hardware structures, all proposed systems could benefit from the functional semantics of such a language, and from other characteristics such as implicit parallelism, freedom from side effects, locality of effects, etc. A compiler would be produced having a single Front-end (language specific) parser and several Back-end (machine specific) code generators. An Intermediate Format is defined to serve as the interface between parser and code generators and interface between this system and other language systems. Benchmark programs were produced. SISAL is designed to express algorithms for execution on computers capable of highly concurrent operation. More specifically, the application area to be supported is numerical computation which strains the limits of high performance machines, and the primary targets for translation of SISAL programs are dataflow data-driven machines. Nevertheless, it has been our intention that the language not have idiosyncrasies reflecting themore » particular nature of the application area or target machine. It should be reasonable for SISAL to evolve into a general purpose language appropriate for writing programs to run on future general parallel computers.« less'],\n",

This paper describes two system designs for online pair programming: real-time synchronous pair programming and non-real-time asynchronous pair programming. An experiment was conducted to test the feasibility of online pair programming, using Squeak eToys as an educational programming language. Nebraska of Squeak eToys, a toolkit for building remote interactions with morphic (object-oriented and visual) projects in Squeak eToys, was used for sharing learners' screens and input devices, such as the keyboard and mouse. In this experiment, the following were compared: co-located pair programming, distributed pair programming, and individual programming, through the statistical analysis of their task scores; and a number of creative ideas and their scores in the final test, using T-test, ANOVA F-test, and post-comparison. The results showed that distributed pair programming is not significantly different from co-located pair programming, and that pair programming is more effective than individual programming. In addition, based on the students' sentiments and class observations, several suggestions are given herein, such as environments or teaching methods in online pair programming. The importance of communication, authority control, and peer pressure in online pair programming is also discussed in this paper. In conclusion, the results of this experimental research show that educators can be helped in designing effective learning systems for online pair programming.\"],\n",

Millions of computer end users need to perform tasks over tabular spreadsheet data, yet lack the programming knowledge to do such tasks automatically. This paper describes the design and implementation of a robust natural language based interface to spreadsheet programming. Our methodology involves designing a typed domain-specific language (DSL) that supports an expressive algebra of map, filter, reduce, join, and formatting capabilities at a level of abstraction appropriate for non-expert users. The key algorithmic component of our methodology is a translation algorithm for converting a natural language specification in the context of a given spreadsheet to a ranked set of likely programs in the DSL. The translation algorithm leverages the spreadsheet spatial and temporal context to assign interpretations to specifications with implicit references, and is thus robust to a variety of ways in which end users can express the same task. The translation algorithm builds over ideas from keyword programming and semantic parsing to achieve both high precision and high recall. We implemented the system as an Excel add-in called NLyze that supports a rich user interaction model including annotating the user's natural language specification and explaining the synthesized DSL programs by paraphrasing them into structured English. We collected a total of 3570 English descriptions for 40 spreadsheet tasks and our system was able to generate the intended interpretation as the top candidate for 94% (97 for the top 3) of those instances.\"],\n",

As main contributions, we mention the finitary presentation of abstract unification, and a concurrent and coordinated abstract semantics consistent with the most common semantics of logic programming.

       "  'A Language for Generic Programming. The past decade of software library construction has demonstrated that the discipline of generic programming is an effective approach to the design and implementation of large-scale software libraries. At the heart of generic programming is a semi-formal interface specification language for generic components. Many programming languages have features for describing interfaces, but none of them match the generic programming specification language, and none are as suitable for specifying generic components. This lack of language support impedes the current practice of generic programming. In this dissertation I present and evaluate the design of a new programming language, named G (for generic), that integrates the generic programming specification language with the type system and features of a full programming language. The design of G is based on my experiences, and those of colleagues, in the construction of generic libraries over the past decade. The design space for programming languages is large, thus this experience is vital in guiding choices among the many tradeoffs. The design of G emphasizes modularity because generic programming is inherently about composing separately developed components. In this dissertation I demonstrate that the design is implementable by constructing a compiler for G (translating to C++) and show the suitability of G for generic programming with prototypes of the Standard Template Library and the Boost Graph Library in G . I formalize the essential features of G in a small language and prove type soundness.'],\n",

       "  'Synthesizing Bijective Lenses. Bidirectional transformations between different data representations occur frequently in modern software systems. They appear as serializers and deserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building bidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are intended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to use a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a single expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to program in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a complex type system. To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of bijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular expressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for disambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a bidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical challenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough. Unlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the context of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of regular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert those generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our synthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language changes the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one that admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark suite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples derived from other data management systems including Flash Fill, a tool for synthesizing string transformations in spreadsheets, and Augeas, a tool for bidirectional processing of Linux system configuration files.'],\n",

Existing approaches mine API mappings from projects that have corresponding versions in two languages. They rely on the sparse availability of bilingual projects, thus producing a limited number of API mappings. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system called DeepAM for automatically mining API mappings from a large-scale code corpus without bilingual projects. The key component of DeepAM is based on the multimodal sequence to sequence learning architecture that aims to learn joint semantic representations of bilingual API sequences from big source code data.

       "  'Designing an algorithm for role analysis. This thesis presents a system for specifying constraints on dynamically changing referencing relationships of heap objects, and an analysis for static verification of these constraints. The constraint specification system is based on the concept of role. The role of an object depends, in large part, on its aliasing relationships with other objects, with the role of each object changing as its aliasing relationships change. In this way roles capture object and data structure properties such as unique references, membership of objects in data structures, disjointness of data structures, absence of representation exposure, bidirectional associations, treeness, and absence or presence of cycles in the heap. Roles generalize linear types by allowing multiple aliases of heap objects that participate in recursive data structures. Unlike graph grammars and graph types, roles contain sufficiently general constraints to conservatively approximate any data structure. We give a semantics for mutually recursive role definitions and derive properties of roles as an invariant specification language. We introduce a programming model that allows temporary violations of role constraints. We describe a static role analysis for verifying that a program conforms to the programming model. The analysis uses fixpoint computation to synthesize loop invariants in each procedure. We introduce a procedure interface specification language and its semantics. We present an interprocedural, compositional, and context-sensitive role analysis that verifies that a program respects the role constraints across procedure calls. Thesis Supervisor: Martin C.

An intergenerational design team of children (ages 7-11 years old) along with graduate students and faculty in computer science and information studies developed a programming language for children, Toque. Concrete real-world cooking scenarios were used as programming metaphors to support an accessible programming learning experience. The Wiimote and Nunchuk were used as physical programming input devices. The programs that were created were pictorial recipes which dynamically controlled animations of an on-screen chef preparing virtual dishes in a graphical kitchen environment. Through multiple design sessions, programming strategies were explored, cooking metaphors were developed and, prototypes of the Toque environment were iterated. Results of these design experiences have shown us the importance of pair-programming, programming by storytelling, parallel programming, function-argument relationships, and the role of tangibility in overcoming challenges with constraints imposed by the system design.'],\n",

       "  'A highly asynchronous minimum spanning tree protocol. In this paper, we present an efficient distributed protocol for constructing a minimum-weight spanning tree (MST). Gallager, Humblet and Spira [5] proposed a protocol for this problem with time and message complexitiesO(N logN) andO(E+NlogN) respectively. A protocol withO(N) time complexity was proposed by Awerbuch [1]. We show that the time complexity of the protocol in [5] can also be expressed asO((D+d) logN), whereD is the maximum degree of a node andd is a diameter of the MST and therefore this protocol performs better than the protocol in [1] wheneverD+d<N/logN. We give a protocol which requiresO(min(N, (D+d)logN)) time andO(E+NlogNlogN/loglogN) messages. The protocol constructs a minimum spanning tree by growing disjoint subtrees of the MST (which are referred to asfragments). Fragments having the same minimum-weight outgoing edge are combined until a single fragment which spans the entire network remains. The protocols in [5] and [1] enforce a balanced growth of fragments. We relax the requirement of balanced growth and obtain a highly asynchronous protocol. In this protocol, fast growing fragments combine more often and there-fore speed up the execution.'],\n",

Wireless sensor networks are often used by experts in many different fields to gather data pertinent to their work. Although their expertise may not include software engineering, these users are expected to produce low-level software for a concurrent, real-time and resource-constrained computing environment. In this paper, we introduce a component-based model for wireless sensor network applications and a language, Insense, for supporting the model. An application is modelled as a composition of interacting components and the application model is preserved in the Insense implementation where active components communicate via typed channels. The primary design criteria for Insense include: to abstract over low-level concerns for ease of programming; to permit worst-case space and time usage of programs to be determinable; to support the fractal composition of components whilst eliminating implicit dependencies between them; and, to facilitate the construction of low footprint programs suitable for resource-constrained devices. This paper presents an overview of the component model and Insense, and demonstrates how they meet the above criteria.'],\n",

In Links, programs combine all of the code of a web application in a single program, and the implementation generates appropriate JavaScript and HTML for the client, and SQL queries for the database. However, installing and using Links is non-trivial, making it difficult for new programmers to get started and learn about Links.

Programmers combine different programming languages because it allows them to use the most suitable language for a given problem, to gradually migrate existing projects from one language to another, or to reuse existing source code. However, existing cross-language mechanisms suffer from complex interfaces, insufficient flexibility, or poor performance. We present the TruffleVM, a multi-language runtime that allows composing different language implementations in a seamless way. It reduces the amount of required boiler-plate code to a minimum by allowing programmers to access foreign functions or objects by using the notation of the host language. We compose language implementations that translate source code to an intermediate representation (IR), which is executed on top of a shared runtime system. Language implementations use language-independent messages that the runtime resolves at their first execution by transforming them to efficient foreign-language-specific operations. The TruffleVM avoids conversion or marshaling of foreign objects at the language boundary and allows the dynamic compiler to perform its optimizations across language boundaries, which guarantees high performance. This paper presents an implementation of our ideas based on the Truffle system and its guest language implementations JavaScript, Ruby, and C.'],\n",

The relations between the different components are defined by compositional interpretation and generation functions, and by corresponding combinatory parsers. This design has been inspired by the logical grammar of Montague. The grammar-driven design makes it easy to extend and to modify the interface, and also to link it with other functionalities such as compiling and semantic reasoning. It is also easy to add new languages to the interface. Both the grammatical theory and the interface facilities based on it have been implemented in the functional programming language Haskell, which supports a declarative and modular style of programming.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data is indeed a challenging problem due to the nature, diversity and volume of the data. People tend to express their feelings freely, which makes Twitter an ideal source for accumulating a vast amount of opinions towards a wide spectrum of topics. This amount of information offers huge potential and can be harnessed to receive the sentiment tendency towards these topics. However, since no one can invest an infinite amount of time to read through these tweets, an automated decision making approach is necessary. Nevertheless, most existing solutions are limited in centralized environments only. Thus, they can only process at most a few thousand tweets. Such a sample is not representative in order to define the sentiment polarity towards a topic due to the massive number of tweets published daily. In this work, we develop two systems: the first in the MapReduce and the second in the Apache Spark framework for programming with Big Data. The algorithm exploits all hashtags and emoticons inside a tweet, as sentiment labels, and proceeds to a classification method of diverse sentiment types in a parallel and distributed manner. Moreover, the sentiment analysis tool is based on Machine Learning methodologies alongside Natural Language Processing techniques and utilizes Apache Spark's Machine learning library, MLlib. In order to address the nature of Big Data, we introduce some pre-processing steps for achieving better results in Sentiment Analysis as well as Bloom filters to compact the storage size of intermediate data and boost the performance of our algorithm. Finally, the proposed system was trained and validated with real data crawled by Twitter, and, through an extensive experimental evaluation, we prove that our solution is efficient, robust and scalable while confirming the quality of our sentiment identification.\"],\n",

Based on a simple non-procedural language with temporal logic operators, Lucid underlies a family of multi-dimensional programming languages based on intensional logic. Intension is a concept rooted in an aspect of natural language called “intensional context”, in which the meaning of a statement (extension) depends on the context in which it is uttered (intension). The implicit temporal feature of Lucid makes it suitable for use as a means of describing dynamic systems. In the past, experiments have been performed and real applications have been developed with programs written in Lucid. However, these systems focused mainly on improving the execution performance of one dialect of Lucid and not address the problem of interpreting variants of Lucid. The GIPSY system is designed to not only process current Lucid variants efficiently but also to be modified easily to accept new dialects of Lucid. In the thesis, we discuss the essence of executing intensional programming languages using the eduction (also called demand-driven or lazy) execution model; describe experiments with different approaches to interpreting programs written in Lucid; and focuses on execution over a network of processors. We describe the implementation of a prototype for executing Lucid programs in a distributed environment. We also explore the advantages of applying the object concept to distributed systems and describe experiments with these methods. In addition, the thesis includes estimates of the impact of integrating computation functions into the Lucid code and proposes an advanced execution model consisting of self-contained and intelligent clients associated with a meta-level resource management.'],\n",

This paper introduces a “crossing-sensitive” generalization of a third-order factorization that trades off complexity in the model structure (i.e., scoring with features over multiple edges) with complexity in the output structure (i.e., producing crossing edges). Under this model, the optimal 1-Endpoint-Crossing tree can be found in O(n4) time, matching the asymptotic run-time of both the third-order projective parser and the edge-factored 1-Endpoint-Crossing parser.

In particular, our model is able to learn correlations among neighboring arcs (siblings and grandparents), word valency, and tendencies toward nearly-projective parses. The model parameters are learned in a max-margin framework by employing a linear programming relaxation. We evaluate the performance of our parser on data in several natural languages, achieving improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.'],\n",

       "  'C# Programming Language. Based on my own experience, I can safely say that every .NET developer who reads this will have at least one aha moment and will be a better developer for it. From the Foreword by Don Box The popular C# programming language combines the high productivity of rapid application development languages with the raw power of C and C++. Updated to cover the new features of C# 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, this release takes the language to the next level by adding the ability to cleanly write programs that dont rely on static type definitions. This allows dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to feel native to C#. The C# Programming Language, Fourth Edition, continues to be the authoritative and annotated technical reference for C# 4.0. Written by Anders Hejlsberg, the languages architect, and his colleagues, Mads Torgersen, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, this volume has been completely updated for C# 4.0. The book provides the complete specification of the language, along with descriptions, reference materials, code samples, and annotations from twelve prominent C# gurus. The many annotations bring a depth and breadth of understanding rarely found in any programming book. As the main text of the book introduces the concepts of the C# language, cogent annotations explain why they are important, how they are used, how they relate to other languages, and even how they evolved. This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#. With annotations from: Brad Abrams, Joseph Albahari, Krzysztof Cwalina, Jesse Liberty, Eric Lippert, Christian Nagel, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Marek Safar, Chris Sells, Peter Sestoft, Jon Skeet, and Bill Wagner.'],\n",

       "  'A decentralized approach for programming interactive applications with JavaScript and blockly. We present a decentralized-control methodology and a tool-set for developing interactive user interfaces. We focus on the common case of developing the client side of Web applications. Our approach is to combine visual programming using Google Blockly with a single-threaded implementation of behavioral programming in JavaScript. We show how the behavioral programming principles can be implemented with minimal programming resources, i.e., with a single-threaded environment using coroutines. We give initial, yet full, examples of how behavioral programming is instrumental in addressing common issues in this application domain, e.g., that it facilitates separation of graphical representation from logic and handling of complex inter-object scenarios. The implementation in JavaScript and Blockly (separately and together) expands the availability of behavioral programming capabilities, previously implemented in LSC, Java, Erlang and C++, to audiences with different skill-sets and design approaches.'],\n",

       "  'TerpreT: A Probabilistic Programming Language for Program Induction. We study machine learning formulations of inductive program synthesis; given input-output examples, we try to synthesize source code that maps inputs to corresponding outputs. Our aims are to develop new machine learning approaches based on neural networks and graphical models, and to understand the capabilities of machine learning techniques relative to traditional alternatives, such as those based on constraint solving from the programming languages community. Our key contribution is the proposal of TerpreT, a domain-specific language for expressing program synthesis problems. TerpreT is similar to a probabilistic programming language: a model is composed of a specification of a program representation (declarations of random variables) and an interpreter describing how programs map inputs to outputs (a model connecting unknowns to observations). The inference task is to observe a set of input-output examples and infer the underlying program. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it enables rapid exploration of a range of domains, program representations, and interpreter models. Second, it separates the model specification from the inference algorithm, allowing like-to-like comparisons between different approaches to inference. From a single TerpreT specification we automatically perform inference using four different back-ends. These are based on gradient descent, linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical models, discrete satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis system. We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models and performing an empirical comparison between alternative inference algorithms. Our key empirical finding is that constraint solvers dominate the gradient descent and LP-based formulations. We conclude with suggestions for the machine learning community to make progress on program synthesis.'],\n",

       "  \"Microtask crowdsourcing for disease mention annotation in PubMed abstracts. Identifying concepts and relationships in biomedical text enables knowledge to be applied in computational analyses. Many biological natural language process (BioNLP) projects attempt to address this challenge, but the state of the art in BioNLP still leaves much room for improvement. Progress in BioNLP research depends on large, annotated corpora for evaluating information extraction systems and training machine learning models. Traditionally, such corpora are created by small numbers of expert annotators often working over extended periods of time. Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in aggregate, generate high-quality annotations of biomedical text. Here, we investigated the use of the AMT in capturing disease mentions in PubMed abstracts. We used the NCBI Disease corpus as a gold standard for refining and benchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol. After several iterations, we arrived at a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the training set of this gold standard with an overall F measure of 0.872 (precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can also be tuned to optimize for precision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or recall (max = 0.980 when precision = 0.436). Each document was examined by 15 workers, and their annotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In total 145 workers combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06 per abstract per worker. The quality of the annotations, as judged with the F measure, increases with the number of workers assigned to each task such that the system can be tuned to balance cost against quality. These results demonstrate that microtask crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for generating well-annotated corpora in BioNLP.\"],\n",

       "  \"Declarative Learning-Based Programming as an Interface to AI Systems. Data-driven approaches are becoming more common as problem-solving techniques in many areas of research and industry. In most cases, machine learning models are the key component of these solutions, but a solution involves multiple such models, along with significant levels of reasoning with the models' output and input. Current technologies do not make such techniques easy to use for application experts who are not fluent in machine learning nor for machine learning experts who aim at testing ideas and models on real-world data in the context of the overall AI system. We review key efforts made by various AI communities to provide languages for high-level abstractions over learning and reasoning techniques needed for designing complex AI systems. We classify the existing frameworks based on the type of techniques and the data and knowledge representations they use, provide a comparative study of the way they address the challenges of programming real-world applications, and highlight some shortcomings and future directions.\"],\n",

       "  'Which of My Transient Type Checks Are Not (Almost) Free?. One form of type checking used in gradually typed language is transient type checking: whenever an object \\'flows\\' through code with a type annotation, the object is dynamically checked to ensure it has the methods required by the annotation. Just-in-time compilation and optimisation in virtual machines can eliminate much of the overhead of run-time transient type checks. Unfortunately this optimisation is not uniform: some type checks will significantly decrease, or even increase, a program\\'s performance. In this paper, we refine the so called\"Takikawa\"protocol, and use it to identify which type annotations have the greatest effects on performance. In particular, we show how graphing the performance of such benchmarks when varying which type annotations are present in the source code can be used to discern potential patterns in performance. We demonstrate our approach by testing the Moth virtual machine: for many of the benchmarks where Moth\\'s transient type checking impacts performance, we have been able to identify one or two specific type annotations that are the likely cause. Without these type annotations, the performance impact of transient type checking becomes negligible. Using our technique programmers can optimise programs by removing expensive type checks, and VM engineers can identify new opportunities for compiler optimisation.']]"

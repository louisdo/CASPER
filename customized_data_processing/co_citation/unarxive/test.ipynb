Our model involves the detailed solution of the coagulation equation at every location in the disk. At regular time intervals we feed the resulting 3-D dust distribution functions into a continuum radiative transfer code to obtain spectral energy distributions. We find that, even if only the very basic -- and well understood -- coagulation mechanisms are included, the process of grain growth is much too quick to be consistent with infrared observations of T Tauri disks. Small grains are removed so efficiently that, long before the disk reaches an age of 1E6 years typical of T Tauri stars, the SED shows only very weak infrared excess. This is inconsistent with observed SEDs of most classical T Tauri stars. Small grains somehow need to be replenished, for instance by aggregate fragmentation through high-speed collisions. A very simplified calculation shows that when aggregate fragmentation is included, a quasi-stationary grain size distribution is obtained in which growth and fragmentation are in equilibrium. This quasi-stationary state may last 1E6 years or even longer, dependent on the circumstances in the disk, and may bring the time scales into the right regime. We conclude that a simple evolutionary scenario in which grains slowly grow from pristine 0.1 micron grains to larger grains over a period of a few Myr is most likely incorrect.'},\n",

The resulting distributions for the Newport-Inglewood, Elsinore, Garlock, and San Andreas faults are in accord with the characteristic earthquake model of fault behavior. The distribution observed along the San Jacinto fault satisfies the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. If attention is limited to segments of the San Jacinto that are marked by the rupture zones of large historical earthquakes or distinct steps in fault trace, the observed distribution along each segment is consistent with the characteristic earthquake model. The Gutenberg-Richter distribution observed for the entirety of the San Jacinto may reflect the sum of seismicity along a number of distinct fault segments, each of which displays a characteristic earthquake distribution. The limited period of instrumental recording is insufficient to disprove the hypothesis that all faults will display a Gutenberg-Richter distribution when averaged over the course of a complete earthquake cycle. But, given that (1) the last 5 decades of seismicity are the best indicators of the expected level of small to moderate-size earthquakes in the next 50 years, and (2) it is generally about this period of time that is of interest in seismic hazard and engineering analysis, the answer to the question posed in the title of the article, at least when concerned with practical implementation of seismic hazard analysis at sites along these major faults, appears to be the “characteristic earthquake distribution.”'},\n",

While an increasing number of studies have been conducted, the resolution of synthesized images is still limited to low (e.g., 256×192), which acts as the critical limitation against satisfying online consumers. We argue that the limitation stems from several challenges: as the resolution increases, the artifacts in the misaligned areas between the warped clothes and the desired clothing regions become noticeable in the final results; the architectures used in existing methods have low performance in generating high-quality body parts and maintaining the texture sharpness of the clothes. To address the challenges, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called VITON-HD that successfully synthesizes 1024×768 virtual try-on images. Specifically, we first prepare the segmentation map to guide our virtual try-on synthesis, and then roughly fit the target clothing item to a given person's body. Next, we propose ALIgnment-Aware Segment (ALIAS) normalization and ALIAS generator to handle the misaligned areas and preserve the details of 1024×768 inputs. Through rigorous comparison with existing methods, we demonstrate that VITON-HD highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized image quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.\"},\n",

We investigate two classes of models, distinguished by the action of the unitary gates, which either are organized in clusters of finite-range two-body gates, or are pair-wise interactions randomly distributed throughout the system with a power-law distribution. We find the range of the interactions plays a key role in characterizing both phases and their measurement-induced transitions. For the cluster unitary gates we find a transition between a phase with volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy and a phase with area-law entanglement entropy. Our results indicate that the universality class of the phase transition is compatible to that of short range hybrid Clifford circuits. Oppositely, in the case of power-law distributed gates, we find the universality class of the phase transition changes continuously with the parameter controlling the range of interactions. In particular, for intermediate values of the control parameter, we find a non-conformal critical line which separates a phase with volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy from one with sub-extensive scaling. Within this region, we find the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic negativity present a cross-over from a phase with algebraic growth of entanglement with system size, and an area-law phase.'},\n",

We compare these results, with an ideal quark gas at high temperature and a hadron resonance gas model at low temperature. We find that fluctuations and correlations are well described by the former already for temperatures about 1.5 times the transition temperature.

We use a numerical approach to demonstrate that AdS black holes beyond the Schwarzschild-AdS solution exist in Einstein-Weyl gravity.

The pressure gradient is estimated from a time series of velocity fields for unsteady calculations or from a single velocity field for quasi-steady calculations. The corresponding pressure field is determined based on median polling of several integration paths through the pressure gradient field in order to reduce the effect of measurement errors that accumulate along individual integration paths. Integration paths are restricted to the nodes of the measured velocity field, thereby eliminating the need for measurement interpolation during this step and significantly reducing the computational cost of the algorithm relative to previous approaches. The method is validated by using numerically-simulated flow past a stationary, two-dimensional bluff body and a computational model of a three-dimensional, self-propelled anguilliform swimmer to study the effects of spatial and temporal resolution, domain size, signal-to-noise ratio, and out of plane effects. Particle image velocimetry measurements of a freely-swimming jellyfish medusa and a freely-swimming lamprey are analyzed using the method to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach when applied to empirical data.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Image content variation is a typical and challenging problem in no-reference image-quality assessment (NR-IQA). This work pays special attention to the impact of image content variation on NR-IQA methods. To better analyze this impact, we focus on blur-dominated distortions to exclude the impacts of distortion-type variations. We empirically show that current NR-IQA methods are inconsistent with human visual perception when predicting the relative quality of image pairs with different image contents. In view of deep semantic features of pretrained image classification neural networks always containing discriminative image content information, we put forward a new NR-IQA method based on semantic feature aggregation (SFA) to alleviate the impact of image content variation. Specifically, instead of resizing the image, we first crop multiple overlapping patches over the entire distorted image to avoid introducing geometric deformations. Then, according to an adaptive layer selection procedure, we extract deep semantic features by leveraging the power of a pretrained image classification model for its inherent content-aware property. After that, the local patch features are aggregated using several statistical structures. Finally, a linear regression model is trained for mapping the aggregated global features to image-quality scores. The proposed method, SFA, is compared with nine representative blur-specific NR-IQA methods, two general-purpose NR-IQA methods, and two extra full-reference IQA methods on Gaussian blur images (with and without Gaussian noise/JPEG compression) and realistic blur images from multiple databases, including LIVE, TID2008, TID2013, MLIVE1, MLIVE2, BID, and CLIVE. Experimental results show that SFA is superior to the state-of-the-art NR methods on all seven databases. It is also verified that deep semantic features play a crucial role in addressing image content variation, and this provides a new perspective for NR-IQA.'},\n",

Recently, it has been shown that this so-called Ouzo effect, i.e. the spontaneous emulsification of oil microdroplets, can also be triggered by the preferential evaporation of ethanol in an evaporating sessile Ouzo drop, leading to an amazingly rich drying process with multiple phase transitions (Tan et al. , Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA , vol. 113 (31), 2016, pp. 8642–8647). Due to the enhanced evaporation near the contact line, the nucleation of oil droplets starts at the rim which results in an oil ring encircling the drop. Furthermore, the oil droplets are advected through the Ouzo drop by a fast solutal Marangoni flow. In this article, we investigate the evaporation of mixture droplets in more detail, by successively increasing the mixture complexity from pure water over a binary water–ethanol mixture to the ternary Ouzo mixture (water, ethanol and anise oil). In particular, axisymmetric and full three-dimensional finite element method simulations have been performed on these droplets to discuss thermal effects and the complicated flow in the droplet driven by an interplay of preferential evaporation, evaporative cooling and solutal and thermal Marangoni flow.

We seed the toolset with point-to-point obstacle avoidance tasks in three different environments and Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) trainers. Air Learning assesses the policies’ performance under various quality-of-flight (QoF) metrics, such as the energy consumed, endurance, and the average trajectory length, on resource-constrained embedded platforms like a Raspberry Pi. We find that the trajectories on an embedded Ras-Pi are vastly different from those predicted on a high-end desktop system, resulting in up to $$40\\\\%$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>40</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math> longer trajectories in one of the environments. To understand the source of such discrepancies, we use Air Learning to artificially degrade high-end desktop performance to mimic what happens on a low-end embedded system. We then propose a mitigation technique that uses the hardware-in-the-loop to determine the latency distribution of running the policy on the target platform (onboard compute on aerial robot). A randomly sampled latency from the latency distribution is then added as an artificial delay within the training loop. Training the policy with artificial delays allows us to minimize the hardware gap (discrepancy in the flight time metric reduced from 37.73% to 0.5%). Thus, Air Learning with hardware-in-the-loop characterizes those differences and exposes how the onboard compute’s choice affects the aerial robot’s performance. We also conduct reliability studies to assess the effect of sensor failures on the learned policies. All put together, Air Learning enables a broad class of deep RL research on UAVs.

State-of-the-art approaches based on the raw click frequencies for modeling the click graph, however, are not noise-eliminated. Nor do they handle heterogeneous query-URL pairs well. In this paper, we investigate and develop a novel entropy-biased framework for modeling click graphs. The intuition behind this model is that various query-URL pairs should be treated differently, i.e., common clicks on less frequent but more specific URLs are of greater value than common clicks on frequent and general URLs. Based on this intuition, we utilize the entropy information of the URLs and introduce a new concept, namely the inverse query frequency (IQF), to weigh the importance (discriminative ability) of a click on a certain URL. The IQF weighting scheme is never explicitly explored or statistically examined for any bipartite graphs in the information retrieval literature. We not only formally define and quantify this scheme, but also incorporate it with the click frequency and user frequency information on the click graph for an effective query representation. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct experiments with the AOL query log data for query similarity analysis and query suggestion tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with our entropy-biased models. Moreover, our method can also be applied to other bipartite graphs.'},\n",

We observe that the purpose of covert communication in many scenarios is to hide the existence of the sender, not the receiver. Therefore, we allow the receiver to work in full-duplex mode such that it can emit artificial noise (AN) while receiving signals simultaneously. We analyse the achievable covert rates with fixed and varying AN power and show that in both fast and slow fading cases, it is possible to achieve a positive covert rate. For the slow fading case, we further extend the proposed strategy to a multi-user scenario, in which multiple other users share the same spectral resource and cause interference at the warden.

The light absorption in ionically dissociated species generates the hydronium radical (H3O) and halogen radical (X) within a charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) excitation process. The hydronium radical ultimately decays into a water molecule and hydrogen atom with a characteristic kinetic energy irrespective of the hydrogen halide. We have also investigated the dynamics of an isolated and water-solvated H3O radical that we view as a central species in water radiation chemistry. The theoretical findings support the following picture of the HX photochemistry on ice nanoparticles investigated in our molecular beam experiments: HX is acidically dissociated in the ground state on ice nanoparticles, generating the CIP structure, which is then excited by the UV laser light into the CTTS states, followed by the H3O radical formation.'},\n",

Our work takes an initial step towards a surgical investigation of SAM for designing coherent continual learning methods in ViTs. We first carry out an evaluation of established continual learning regularization techniques. We then examine the effect of regularization when applied to two key enablers of SAM: (a) the contextualized embedding layers, for their ability to capture well-scaled representations with respect to the values, and (b) the prescaled attention maps, for carrying value-independent global contextual information. We depict the perks of each distilling strategy on two image recognition benchmarks (CIFAR100 and ImageNet-32) – while (a) leads to a better overall accuracy, (b) helps enhance the rigidity by maintaining competitive performances. Furthermore, we identify the limitation imposed by the symmetric nature of regularization losses. To alleviate this, we propose an asymmetric variant and apply it to the pooled output distillation (POD) loss adapted for ViTs. Our experiments confirm that introducing asymmetry to POD boosts its plasticity while retaining stability across (a) and (b). Moreover, we acknowledge low forgetting measures for all the compared methods, indicating that ViTs might be naturally inclined continual learners. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>'},\n",

In the context of a validation data where treatment assignment is accurate, we show that misclassification of treatment assignment can impact three distinct stages of a propensity score analysis: (i) propensity score estimation; (ii) propensity score implementation; and (iii) outcome analysis conducted conditional on the estimated propensity score and its implementation. We examine how the error in $T$ impacts each stage in the context of three common propensity score implementations: subclassification, matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Using validation data, we propose a two-step likelihood-based approach which fully adjusts for treatment misclassification bias under subclassification.

To extend the computing capability, the nearest roadside-unit (RSU) is used to offload the tasks.

To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a joint optimization approach on offloading and resource allocation for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Specifically, assuming particle tasks assigned for vehicles in the system model are offloaded to RSUs and executed in parallel. Moreover, the software-defined networking (SDN) assisted routing and controlling protocol is introduced to divide the IoV system into two independent layers: data transmission layer and control layer.

We argue that this ability is largely due to three main reasons: the incorporation of prior knowledge (or experience), the adaptation of it to the new environment using the observed visual cues and most importantly optimistically searching without giving up early. This is currently missing in the state-of-the-art visual navigation methods based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose to use externally learned prior knowledge of the relative object locations and integrate it into our model by constructing a neural graph. In order to efficiently incorporate the graph without increasing the state-space complexity, we propose Graph-based Value Estimation (GVE) module. GVE provides a more accurate baseline for estimating the Advantage function in actor-critic RL algorithm. This results in reduced value estimation error and, consequently, convergence to a more optimal policy.

       "'Mixings of four-quark components in light nonsinglet scalar mesons in QCD sum rules. Mixings of four-quark components in the nonsinglet scalar mesons are studied in the QCD sum rules. We propose a formulation to evaluate the cross correlators of $q\\\\overline{q}$ and $qq\\\\overline{q}\\\\overline{q}$ operators and to define the mixings of different Fock states in the sum rule. It is applied to the nonsinglet scalar mesons, ${a}_{0}$ and ${K}_{0}^{*}$. It is found that the four-quark operators predict lower masses than the $q\\\\overline{q}$ operators and that the four-quark states occupy about 70%--90% of the lowest mass states'"

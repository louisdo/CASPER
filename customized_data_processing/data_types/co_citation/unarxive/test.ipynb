       "  'abstract': 'Based on the curricula vitae and survey responses of 443 academic scientists affiliated with university research centers in the USA, we examine the longstanding assumption that research collaboration has a positive effect on publishing productivity. Since characteristics of the individual and the work environment are endogenously related to both collaboration and productivity, this study focuses on the mediating effect of collaboration on publishing productivity. By using the two-stage least squares analysis, the findings indicate that in the presence of moderating variables such as age, rank, grant, gender, marital status, family relations, citizenship, job satisfaction, perceived discrimination, and collaboration strategy, the simple number (‘normal count’) of peer-reviewed journal papers is strongly and significantly associated with the number of collaborators. However, the net impacts of collaboration are less clear. When we apply the same model and examine productivity by ‘fractional count’, dividing the number of publications by the number of authors, we find that number of collaborators is not a significant predictor of publishing productivity. In both cases, ‘normal count’ and ‘fractional count’, we find significant effects of research grants, citizenship, collaboration strategy, and scientific field. We believe that it is important to understand the effects of the individual and environmental factors for developing effective strategies to exploit the potential benefits of collaboration. We note that our focus is entirely at the individual level, and some of the most important benefits of collaboration may accrue to groups, institutions, and scientific fields.'},\n",

Efforts to parameterize SDMs often create a tension between the quality and quantity of data available to fit models. Estimation methods that integrate both standardized and non-standardized data types offer a potential solution to the tradeoff between data quality and quantity. Recently several authors have developed approaches for jointly modeling two sources of data (one of high quality and one of lesser quality). We extend their work by allowing for explicit spatial autocorrelation in occurrence and detection error using a Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive (MVCAR) model and develop three models that share information in a less direct manner resulting in more robust performance when the auxiliary data is of lesser quality. We describe these three new approaches (\"Shared,\" \"Correlation,\" \"Covariates\") for combining data sources and show their use in a case study of the Brown-headed Nuthatch in the Southeastern U.S. and through simulations. All three of the approaches which used the second data source improved out-of-sample predictions relative to a single data source (\"Single\"). When information in the second data source is of high quality, the Shared model performs the best, but the Correlation and Covariates model also perform well. When the information quality in the second data source is of lesser quality, the Correlation and Covariates model performed better suggesting they are robust alternatives when little is known about auxiliary data collected opportunistically or through citizen scientists. Methods that allow for both data types to be used will maximize the useful information available for estimating species distributions.'},\n",

The very simple sorting mechanisms render our algorithms an elegant design framework, and, in turn, the surprisingly succinct implementations.

Probability hypothesis density (PHD) filters are running locally in every sensor for MTT. The weighted arithmetic average (WAA) fusion rule is employed to fuse the multiple local PHD densities due to its computational efficiency. First, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that the standard WAA fusion among sensors with different FoVs is unsuitable from the perspective of the principle of minimum discrimination information (PMDI). In fact, the information inconsistency among sensors due to the different FoVs unavoidably leads to an underestimation of the fused PHD. Then, motivated by the analysis, we devise two novel approaches to address the different FoV issue. The first approach accounts for the case where the sensor FoVs are known and time-invariant. The second one deals with the more complicated case where the actual sensor FoVs can be cropped due to unknown line of sight obstructions or sensors can obtain the information outside their current FoVs because of platform movement or information feedback. The essence of the proposed approaches is to perform the WAA in a more robust way by employing a set of state-dependent fusion weights which are computed online. The Gaussian mixture implementations of the proposed methods are also presented. Various simulation experiments, including a challenging tracking scenario involving six sensors with different FoVs and also random line of sight obstructions, are designed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed fusion approaches.'},\n",

For intrinsically low-rank tensor observations with arbitrary outlier corruption, OR-TPCA is the first method that has provable performance guarantee for exactly recovering the tensor subspace and detecting outliers under mild conditions.

Overhead imagery data, for instance, have the potential to greatly enhance autonomous robot navigation in complex outdoor environments. In practice, reliable and effective automated interpretation of imagery from diverse terrain, environmental conditions, and sensor varieties proves challenging. Similarly, fixed techniques that successfully interpret on‐board sensor data across many environments begin to fail past short ranges as the density and accuracy necessary for such computation quickly degrade and features that are able to be computed from distant data are very domain specific. We introduce an online, probabilistic model to effectively learn to use these scope‐limited features by leveraging other features that, while perhaps otherwise more limited, generalize reliably. We apply our approach to provide an efficient, self‐supervised learning method that accurately predicts traversal costs over large areas from overhead data. We present results from field testing on‐board a robot operating over large distances in various off‐road environments.

Particle‐size spectra were measured with a LISST‐100 laser diffraction instrument placed on a frame on the seabed. A 1200 kHz ADCP in the same frame was used to measure vertical current profiles and from these the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate was determined using the structure function method. Median particle size is observed to change in a regular way by a factor of 3 or more over each tidal cycle, with the largest particles observed at slack tide and the smallest at times of maximum flood and ebb. The most likely explanation of this change is that particles are aggregating at times of low turbulence and breaking up during fast flows. A simple dynamical flocculation model that incorporates these processes gives good agreement with observations, particularly if tidal advection of a longitudinal gradient in particle size is allowed for. If particles have time to reach equilibrium with ambient conditions, the model predicts that the particle size will be proportional to the product of concentration and the Kolmogorov microscale. The observations support this prediction on most tidal cycles if a phase lag (of 30–60 min) is allowed between the measurements of particle size and Kolmogorov scale. This phase lag represents the adjustment time for flocs to respond to change in turbulence. The constant of proportionality between median particle size and Kolmogorov scale increases with particle volume.'},\n",

In the latter two cases, vortex knots occur frequently, even in random eigenfunctions at relatively low energy, and are constrained by the spatial symmetries of the modes.

To demonstrate this ability, the wavelength-dependent 1D effective thermal diffusivity of pure germanium is measured using this type of response and found to be consistent with theoretical predictions made by solving the Boltzmann transport equation.

In this paper, the reasons for the difficulties are examined and it is proposed that the tensor functionals currently favored are in fact numerically unstable. By reverting to an older, more heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are eliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of power of cDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system. First, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall crystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are clearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast, droplets in a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower temperatures and eventually show the same spontaneous localization of the density into \"atoms\" but in an amorphous structure having many of the structural characteristics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at the same temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the fcc structure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones solids. The fcc crystals have lower free energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more stable than the liquid droplets. It is demonstrated that as the temperature is raised, the free energy differences between the structures decrease until the solid clusters become less stable than the liquid droplets and spontaneously melt. The presence of energy barriers separating the various structures is therefore clearly demonstrated.'},\n",

They have also shown promising results for synthesizing new designs, which is crucial for creating products and enabling innovation. Generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), have proven to be effective for design synthesis with applications ranging from product design to metamaterial design. These automated computational design methods can support human designers, who typically create designs by a time-consuming process of iteratively exploring ideas using experience and heuristics. However, there are still challenges remaining in automatically synthesizing ‘creative’ designs. GAN models, however, are not capable of generating unique designs, a key to innovation and a major gap in AI-based design automation applications. This paper proposes an automated method, named CreativeGAN, for generating novel designs. It does so by identifying components that make a design unique and modifying a GAN model such that it becomes more likely to generate designs with identified unique components. The method combines state-of-art novelty detection, segmentation, novelty localization, rewriting, and generative models for creative design synthesis. Using a dataset of bicycle designs, we demonstrate that the method can create new bicycle designs with unique frames and handles, and generalize rare novelties to a broad set of designs.

The initial spark location inside the chamber is vital to ensure successful ignition. An ignition probability map was elaborated varying the location of a 532 nm laser-induced spark in the chamber under ultralean nominal conditions (ϕ = 0.61). The outer recirculation zone (ORZ) was found to be the best region for placing a spark and successfully igniting the mixture. A strong correlation was found between the ignition probability field and the airflow turbulent kinetic energy and velocity fields. Local equivalence ratio enhances the importance of the ORZ.

In this paper, we show how a robust model predictive control (MPC) with PVO constraints under non-parametric uncertainty can be made computationally tractable. At the core of our formulation is a novel yet simple interpretation of our robust MPC as a problem of matching the distribution of PVO with a certain desired distribution. To this end, we propose two methods. Our first baseline method is based on approximating the distribution of PVO with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and subsequently performing distribution matching using Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence metric. Our second formulation is based on the possibility of representing arbitrary distributions as functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We use this foundation to interpret our robust MPC as a problem of minimizing the distance between the desired distribution and the distribution of the PVO in the RKHS. Both the RKHS and GMM based formulation can work with any uncertainty distribution and thus allowing us to relax the prevalent Gaussian assumption in the existing works. We validate our formulation by taking an example of 2D navigation of quadrotors with a realistic noise model for perception and ego-motion uncertainty. In particular, we present a systematic comparison between the GMM and the RKHS approach and show that while both approaches can produce safe trajectories, the former is highly conservative and leads to poor tracking and control costs. Furthermore, RKHS based approach gives better computational times that are up to one order of magnitude lesser than the computation time of the GMM based approach.'},\n",

In this paper, we investigate magnetic resonance in the quenched SkX state, which is obtained by the rapid cooling of the high-temperature equilibrium SkX phase in the chiral magnetic insulator ${\\\\mathrm{Cu}}_{2}\\\\mathrm{O}\\\\mathrm{Se}{\\\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$. At low temperatures, sextupole and octupole excitation modes of skyrmions are identified, which are usually inactive for oscillating magnetic fields ${B}^{\\\\ensuremath{\\\\nu}}$ with GHz-range frequency $\\\\ensuremath{\\\\nu}$ but turn out to be detectable through the hybridization with the ${B}^{\\\\ensuremath{\\\\nu}}$-active counterclockwise and breathing modes, respectively. The observed magnetic excitation spectra are well reproduced by theoretical calculations, which demonstrates that the effective magnetic anisotropy enhanced at low temperatures is the key for the observed hybridization between the ${B}^{\\\\ensuremath{\\\\nu}}$-active and ${B}^{\\\\ensuremath{\\\\nu}}$-inactive modes.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modern services comprise interconnected components, e.g., microservices in a service mesh, that can scale and run on multiple nodes across the network on demand. To process incoming traffic, service components have to be instantiated and traffic assigned to these instances, taking capacities and changing demands into account. This challenge is usually solved with custom approaches designed by experts. While this typically works well for the considered scenario, the models often rely on unrealistic assumptions or on knowledge that is not available in practice (e.g., a priori knowledge). We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that learns how to best coordinate services and is geared towards realistic assumptions. It interacts with the network and relies on available, possibly delayed monitoring information. Rather than defining a complex model or an algorithm how to achieve an objective, our model-free approach adapts to various objectives and traffic patterns. An agent is trained offline without expert knowledge and then applied online with minimal overhead. Compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic, it significantly improves flow throughput and overall network utility on real-world network topologies and traffic traces. It also learns to optimize different objectives, generalizes to scenarios with unseen, stochastic traffic patterns, and scales to large real-world networks.'},\n",

We show that determination of the quantum correlation measure is possible even if we utilize a restricted set of local measurements. We find that the determination allows us to obtain a closed form of quantum discord and quantum work deficit for several classes of states, with a low error. We show that the computational error caused by the constraint over the complete set of local measurements reduces fast with an increase in the size of the restricted set, implying usefulness of constrained optimization, especially with the increase of dimensions. We perform quantitative analysis to investigate how the error scales with the system size, taking into account a set of plausible constructions of the constrained set. Carrying out a comparative study, we show that the resource required to optimize quantum work deficit is usually higher than that required for quantum discord. We also demonstrate that minimization of quantum discord and quantum work deficit is easier in the case of two-qubit mixed states of fixed ranks and with positive partial transpose in comparison to the corresponding states having nonpositive partial transpose. Applying the methodology to quantum spin models, we show that the constrained optimization can be used with advantage in analyzing such systems in quantum information-theoretic language. For bound entangled states, we show that the error is significantly low when the measurements correspond to the spin observables along the three Cartesian coordinates, and thereby we obtain expressions of quantum discord and quantum work deficit for these bound entangled states.'},\n",

Using relative calibrations, we derive a formula for the second variation of the volume of a Lagrangian submanifold $L^3$ in a strict nearly Kahler manifold $(M^6, J, g)$ and compare it with McLean's formula for special Lagrangian submanifolds. We describe a finite dimensional local model of the moduli space of compact Lagrangian submanifolds in a strict nearly Kahler 6-manifold. We show that there is a real analytic atlas on $(M^6, J, g)$ in which the strict nearly Kahler structure $(J, g)$ is real analytic. Furthermore, w.r.t. an analytic strict nearly Kahler structure the moduli space of Lagrangian submanifolds of $M^6$ is a real analytic variety, whence infinitesimal Lagrangian deformations are smoothly obstructed if and only if they are formally obstructed. As an application, we relate our results to the description of Lagrangian submanifolds in the sphere $S^6$ with the standard nearly Kahler structure described in [34].\"},\n",

We provide bounds in expectation and in high probability (that hold iteration-wise), with the latter derived by leveraging a sub-Weibull model for the errors affecting the gradient. The convergence results show that the instantaneous regret converges linearly up to an error that depends on the variability of the problem and the statistics of the sub-Weibull gradient error. Similar convergence results are then provided for the online proximal-gradient method, under the assumption that the composite cost satisfies the proximal-PL condition. In the case of static costs, we provide new bounds for the regret incurred by these methods when the gradient errors are modeled as sub-Weibull random variables. Illustrative simulations are provided to corroborate the technical findings.'}}"
